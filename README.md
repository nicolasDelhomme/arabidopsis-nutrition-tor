## Abstract
In eukaryotes, TOR (Target Of Rapamycin) is a conserved regulator of growth that integrates both endogenous and exogenous signals. These signals include the internal nutritional status, and in plants TOR has been shown to be regulated by carbon, nitrogen and sulfur availability. In this study, we show that in Arabidopsis the TOR pathway also integrates phosphorus availability to actively modulate the cell cycle, which in turn regulates the intracellular content of amino acids and organic acids. We observed a substantial overlap between the phenotypic, metabolic and transcriptomic responses of TOR inactivation and phosphorus starvation in Arabidopsis cell culture. Although phosphorus availability modulates TOR activity, changes in the levels of TOR activity do not alter the expression of marker genes for phosphorus status. These data prompted us to place the sensing of phosphorus availability upstream of the modulation of TOR activity which, in turn, regulates the cell cycle and primary metabolism to adjust plant growth.
